Explaination:


// API is an interface that helps us to intercat with a web server. 
// It allows us to send a request on the server and return back result to us.

// 4 main requests:
// 1. GET: which retrieves data from the server. 
// 2. POST:which sents data to the server, to save it or utilize it later on.
// 3. PUT: which is used to update data on a server.
// 4. DELETE: which is to delete data from a server.


Explaination In Easy Way:

API (Application Programming Interface):

An API, or Application Programming Interface, is like a waiter in a restaurant. Imagine you're a customer (an application or 
program), and you want to order something (request data or functionality) from the kitchen (a server or another application). 
Instead of going into the kitchen yourself, you give your order to the waiter, who then communicates with the kitchen staff 
and brings your food back to you. In this analogy:


You (Customer): Your application or program.

Waiter: The API. It takes your requests and communicates with the "kitchen" (server or another application).

Kitchen: The server or the part of another application that performs the requested actions or retrieves data.

So, an API allows different software applications to communicate and share services, much like a waiter facilitates 
communication between a customer and the kitchen.


RESTful API:

RESTful API is a specific style of API design, and it's like ordering from a menu. You have a clear menu (set of predefined 
operations or endpoints), and you use standard methods (like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to interact with it. This structure makes 
things easy to understand and consistent, just like knowing that when you order from a menu, you follow certain conventions.

Now, let's briefly explain the four main types of HTTP methods used in RESTful APIs:

GET: Think of it as asking for the menu. You're not changing anything; you just want to see what's available.

POST: This is like placing a new order. You're sending some data (your order) to be processed.

PUT: Imagine you ordered something, but you want to make a change to it. PUT is like telling the waiter to replace your 
current order with a new one.

DELETE: If you decide you don't want your order anymore, you ask the waiter to remove it. Similarly, DELETE is used to delete 
or remove something from the server
